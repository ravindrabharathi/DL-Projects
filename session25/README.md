1. We downloaded Indian car images from the internet , cleaned up the images and resized them to 100x100 .
2. We selected 1000 of these images as dataset for training 
3. We used a blog post from machinelearningmastery site as reference and the GAN architecture included 
>> a dicriminator that too 100x100 images as input and classified using sigmoid whether an image was a real car or not

>> a generator that took a latent vector of size 100 as input, converted it into a 2d image array and used deconvolution to upsample it to 100x100 size

4. We trained upto 3000 epochs but the training started to degenerate at around 2300-2400 epochs. The notebook contains images generated by models saved at 2300 and 2350 epochs.

5. the generated images are clearly not perfect and we have to revisit the training strategy by using among other things a larger latent vector and better normalization of layers (e.g InstanceNormalization) , etc
