# Image Classification using CIFAR 10 dataset : Grad-CAM visualization and Cutout Image Augmentation

In this exercise we will train a model to classify images from CIFAR10 dataset . 

Then we will integrate [Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping or Grad-CAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391) heatmap visualization on a selection of 4 correctly classified and 4 misclassified images 

We will then use an augmentation technique called [CutOut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04552) or [random erasing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.04896) to train the same model 

With the new model trained with cutout augmenation , we will make predictions on the previous set of images and visualize using Grad-CAM once again
